How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I make sure my code is at my best quality to ensure it is functional and secure. I accomplish this through my debugging process, continuous re-freshening of the requirements, and using the new software updates.

My debugging process is continuous through the creation process. This helps control any human error within the writing of the code and makes finishing the base code of the program quicker.

I mentioned earlier that I re-fresh my understanding of the requirements continuously throughout the writing. Re-reading the requirements is a productive way to ensure that I match the requirements needed for my program.

Lastly, I check the make sure the program is secure with the newest additions of the tools used to create the program. Updates are useful tools that sometimes help to not allow outside users to intrude into the data within the current program. To protect the safety with data breaches, Updates for items being used are needed. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Within this class we were given guidelines that our program must match. However, using my past classes as examples, I would use the begin scrum meeting with clients to receive the information that a future program would need to match. Using documentation during these meetings could be used as a guideline resource for future projects and software creations.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach building software using the two thoughts of what does the program need to do and what parts are needed to execute this action. Using the items I uploaded from this class's assignment, we were given the task of a contact service program. A contact must hold and change information about people and the people must match an ID, the first and last name of the person, and address details. After I create the base of what the items within a contact is, I then re-read the guide for the requirements for each detail within the contact; for example, the ID must be 10 characters or less and cannot be null. After that I do my usual getters and setters and move on to the service item which will add, delete, and edit the contact descriptions. After the debug of the base syntax is complete, that is when the testers may start. 
The creation of the testers is similar to the program approach. What is the item being tested do? How will it interact? After that the tester will contain the base interaction and the failed interactions. Failing tests are important because they ensure that the requirements of the items are met.
